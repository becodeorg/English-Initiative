# English Initiative

## The Pitch

The English Initiative is a **compilation of challenges** to help trainees practice and improve their English proficiency to, hopefully, give them access to more **documentation** and **job opportunities**.

The two main goals being to **raise awareness** on the importance of English in the ICT sector as well as provide **learning opportunities** through an **active pedagogy** approach.

> **NOTE**: Since the challenges in this initiative aim to emulate those within the course (_web development_, _DevSecOps_, _data science_), they have been written in English. That implies that a **fundamental reading proficiency is required** (_Google Translate_).

## The Content

You can find the available challenges in the `./content` directory of this repository. Take what you need and share it with your trainees.
