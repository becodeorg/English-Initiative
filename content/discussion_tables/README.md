## The Mission

Picture yourself in a meeting with people unable to speak your mother tongue, you're best bet being to speak English. How would you fare? Regardless of the answer, "_speaking_" is **one of the hardest** skills to get good at when learning a language.

Partially due to the fact that you need enough **vocabulary** and **grammar**, but mainly because **speaking triggers the fear of being ridicule**. That fear is the main obstacle [to overcome](https://www.fluentin3months.com/fear-of-speaking/) and the best way is [to practice](https://www.fluentin3months.com/speak-it/)!

In order to do that, this challenge will have you **organize** and **partake in** a discussion table. Follow the instructions below (_example_) to get started:

* get in groups of maximum 5
* choose a "_game master_" to lead the activity
* [choose a theme](./assets/topics.md) for the discussion
* individually write 3 thoughts on the theme
* start talking under the lead of the "_game master_"

> **NOTE**: The instructions above are but one implementation. If you want to do things differently, feel free to do so as long as the goal remain to **practice speaking**.
