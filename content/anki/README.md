## The Mission

So you want to **learn English** but you **don't have hours to spend** practicing everyday!? Worry not as with the right tool you'll be able to exercise **quickly** and **efficiently** whenever you have time to kill, even on the toilet.

Preposterous, you say! Well, not when learning with the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition ) technique and [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard). I could venture to write my own explanation, but it wouldn't be as good as linking an [article](https://usm.maine.edu/agile/using-flashcards) on the subject. In short, it's an efficient learning method to **memorize** words (_and their meaning_), concepts, ideas, you name it...

That sounds just about perfect to practice vocabulary, doesn't it? Well, this challenge will have you setup your own spaced repetition environment using [Anki](://apps.ankiweb.net/), an **SRS** (_spaced repetition software_), for that very reason.

> **NOTE**: There are plenty of alternatives to _Anki_, but we'll use it here as it's a flexible free and open source application. However, if you want to use something else feel free to do so.

To get started you'll first need to **install Anki**, you should be able to find an application for every major platform (_Windows_, _Linux_, _Android_, _Apple_, ...). Then and since _Anki_ can be complex, you should read the following articles from [leananki](https://leananki.com/) to guide you through the usage and good practices.

- [How to use Anki](https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/)
- [Creating effective decks](https://leananki.com/creating-effective-decks/)
- [Creating better flashcards](https://leananki.com/creating-better-flashcards/)
- [Best settings](https://leananki.com/best-settings/)

As stated multiple times within the shared articles above, it's very important that you **create your own decks** for better results. However that doesn't mean that you should blindly start creating your vocabulary list.

Therefore here is a list of the [3000 most common words](https://www.ef.fr/ressources-anglais/vocabulaire-anglais/top-3000/) in English. You can slowly **add them** to your deck **as you learn them**.
